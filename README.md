# Pomodoro Timer with Spotify Integration ðŸŽ¶

This project is a **Pomodoro Timer** application built with **React.js**. It integrates with the **Spotify API** to play curated playlists during focus and break sessions and displays random facts for user duting break time. This timer uses various animations to create a calm and engaging background experience. 

# Problem It Solves
When working on tasks that require sustained concentration, many people struggle with maintaining focus and taking efficient breaks. The Pomodoro Technique offers a solution for better time management, but conventional Pomodoro app lacks engaging features.  This app solves the following challenges:

- **Focus Retention:** By structuring work and break intervals, it helps users stay on task and take necessary breaks to prevent burnout.
- **Enhanced Breaks with Random Facts:** Users receive a random fact during breaks, shifting their focus temporarily and improving relaxation.
- **Music for Different Moods:** The app integrates Spotify playlists to provide background music tailored to each phase: calming tunes during focus sessions and uplifting tracks during breaks. Importantly, this **decreases interaction with the phone or external websites**, since music can be controlled within app, helping user to stay focused. 
- **Visual Engagement:** Animated backgrounds change based on the focus or break mode, keeping the experience visually dynamic.

## Features
- **Pomodoro Timer:** Toggle between focus (25 minutes) and break (5 minutes) modes.
- **Spotify Playlist Integration:** Plays 'Deep Focus' and 'Cheerful Uplifting Mix' music playlists from Spotify for focus and break sessions respectively.
- **Audio Controls:** Play, pause, and skip tracks.
- **Random Facts:** Fetches a random fact during each break to distract person's attention during break time.
- **Background Animations:** Animated backgrounds that switch based on the timer mode.
